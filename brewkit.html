        artisan-homebrew-making-legend status.

      <p>
        Our ingenious kit contains a bottle lid with a pressure release system
        that helps prevent the bottle becoming over pressurised.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can use fruit juice, soda or make your own flavours. Takes around a
        week to brew.
      </p>
      <p>
        You won't find the bottles, but take a chill pill sis, all you need is a
        standard 2 litre soda bottle and you'll find we've included all the
        instuctions for you before you embark upon your noble homebrew quest.
      </p>
      <p>
        The kit itself might not look fancy, but we can promise you'll have a
        shedload of fun cooking up a storm, and the results are, frankly, just
        hippy dippy dude.
      </p>
      <p>
        The standard kit has 3 caps and valves and enough yeast and cleaner to
        make around 40 bottles of home brew.

        TechnoHippy's less fun but very organised cousin, The Logistics Hippy,
        dispatches all our items by courier for delivery usually within 1-2
        working days (although it can take an extra day or two during peak times
        of the year).
        <br /><br />
        Your order will be shipped in as few parcels as possible to keep your
        piggin' shipping costs down, and to reduce the impact on the
        environment. So if you order multiple bundles and other products in one
        order, it will most likely come in one parcel. If you require separate
        parcels for multiple bundles you will need to make another separate
        order.
